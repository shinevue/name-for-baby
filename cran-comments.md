Sorry about this - I just noticed I had the date range in the package title, so here's a very minor update.

---

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.2.3
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.2.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 notes

* Checking installed package size:
  installed size is  8.7Mb
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
    data   8.6Mb

  This is a data package that will be rarely.

## Reverse dependencies

There are no reverse dependencies.
